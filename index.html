HOSPITAL

I know that you’re next
soon it’ll be my turn
forgetting about the harm you did

this is what you wanted
this is what you made
family of two all by yourselves

twisting my words
my whole life
leaving behind another broken generation

memory care
scared as hell
push us away just to save yourself

hospital phone by your side
you call and call again each night
you stay just the same every time
you’re just a replica now



MIND MAN WORLD

It’s a cold cold america x2

the souls have no where to roam
my body has no room to grow

disappear into the lake
my flesh will rot
I become bone

so Ill slowly decompose
down here not coming home

nothin left for you to find
an empty shell
a hollow tree

it’s a cold cold america x2

the souls have no where to roam
my body has no room to grow
I hope to find a little peace
my mind is not what it used to be

LOSS AND CHANGE
    (unintelligible)

STORIES

not all of this is mine to share
your memories are mine to bare
Im sorry this is how it is
nothing much left to give

don’t believe in your god no more
idont know if I did before
he let me down too many times
now all I have are my
stories I’ll never know
oh please let go


I suppose I didn’t even know
who you were long before you got old
am I saying empty words
just to make yourself feel worse

when its your time you decide
well be right here ill be your guide
this is what I would’ve said
had we been there before you dead
stories well never know
oh please don’t go


overwhelming feeling now
getting harder to figure it out
she said to me don’t worry baby
you haven’t been sleeping lately

used to lie wide awake at night
wondering what it might be like
to lose all your memories
would I be scared or would I be free
stories you’ll never know
oh please just go

hypermetamodern Collection and Curation of Image during the age of the Internet

i
From the Modernist rejection and uncertainty of knowledge, to the Postmodernist awareness of the modern,
its skepticism and irony, art reaches no other alternative that to move past this and head towards truth and honesty.
The Information Age and the Internet force art out of its corner and into a “quest for truth” (Turner 2011).
Image takes on a new role as it is continuously repurposed on the Internet. As it is appropriated from one person to the next,
it is farther and farther removed from the artist. Art has lost its owner. Image is now for the sake of Image, not the artist.

ii
In Artie Vierkant’s The Image Object Post-Internet (2010) he argues that the Post-Internet Image has lost authorship,
and the reproduced image is seen more than the original. The world is given this latest version of art from of a combination
of occurrences in the past century and a half. With the Industrial Revolution, it starts with the need for the revolution in thought,
and starting with modernism we see the first major shift after the Enlightenment. Next, after WWII there is a step to the Minimal,
and then the postminimal, which would later be associated alongside the Postmodern. The farther away from the Enlightenment,
the more crossover and intermixing there is within style, concept, and context. For the context of the article,
the end of Modernism will be defined by the demolition of the Pruitt-Igoe housing project on July 15th, 1972 (Charles Jencks).
This is the first time there is a reaction to culture itself, rather than an event that happened within it (i.e. natural or man-made disaster).
We enter enter a postmodern cynicism and irony-filled critiques of everything modern. As this grows and transforms with the Internet into the Millennium,
we see the latest shift. This is the changing of not just the art or the artist, but the context of art’s distribution.

iii
The reproduction of image is an attempt to use what is already available, and to simultaneously make the old ever new.
At the same time, an image is distributed so quickly that its lifespan is very short-lived. This makes available an easily created collection of media.
Looking at websites such as Instagram, Pintrest, Tumblr, and other sites of image collection, we see entirely personalized curations.
They become a fragmented curatorial work of art. These collections hardly cite or give credit where it is deserved, and move on.
They do not claim to own those images, but there generally is no distinction between the original and copy.
In the last half-century we can look at many other forms leading up to this. In literature, in 1969 we have Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five,
and today’s feminist like books Syzygy, Beauty (Fleischmann, 2011) and The Argonauts (Nelson, 2015).
All of these explore a mixed and woven nature of writing. Musically, we have more broken story-telling albums such as Childish Gambino’s Awaken, My Love,
Tyler, the Creator’s Flower Boy, and SZA’s Ctrl. Visual artists such as Mark Dion, Louise Nevelson, and An Kowara all explore collection to not enforce,
but enhance and evolve. This fragmentation is due to the way language and ideas are perceived.
Idea and thought have reached a point where, with the availability of information, we must reach out and extend beyond the usual means of understanding.
We have the capability to go further to explain experiences, to make the most of what is available. This collision of multimedia, or how a medium is used, is at its highest peak yet.
This has always been an interest, but we have now stretched the boundaries to their extremes. Leaving us to curate what we have. When collection becomes intentional, it reaches curation.
Found in Hoffmann’s Artists as Curators as Artists, The YBA show Freeze (1988) tests the water for artists to curate themselves.
In The Brooklyn Museum Collection: The Play of the Unmentionable (1990), similar to a salon-style exhibition,
but with intentional intermixing of time periods. The Artists evade the usual and expected curatorial process.
At the same time, the curators were reimagining and creating re-auratizations (Walter Benjamin) of the shows that had been previously on display
as a way to point out new differences and create new conversations around the pieces.

iv
These syntheses of the Modern and Postmodern attitudes create an entirely new form. The Millennial is born, and soon to follow is Metamodernism.
A term expanded on by Luke Turner in 2011 in the Metamodernist Manifesto, published online. Millennials have been the first generation to grow up with
unlimited access to communication and information, as well as not having a major war draft in place (1973 end of the Vietnam War).
Technology grows at a fast enough pace that we now watch it become obsolete in a matter of a few years. An item we grew up with is long gone by the time we are young adults,
allowing us to find nostalgia for items faster than any past generation prior. Along with this, photographs become so widely used
that we are able to capture any and every moment on film. This allows for reminiscence of past events, and a longing for the old days at an extremely young age.
Image and video is now no longer a believable substrate for the truth. The Metamodernist is usually unknowingly so, no matter how self-aware.
In Boris Groys’ Politics of Installation, he introduces the idea of the pharmakon. This is not merely just a reaction, and rather a cure of a disease.
The disease is here modern and postmodern ideology. Following the Metamodernist Manifesto, there is a need to fix what was before (rejection of knowledge and nothingness),
the need for truth, the obsession of the past and the awareness of the future, all while still needing to be ever-present.

v
The collection becomes a way to define a new truth. We see it on a casual level in social media, pop culture, and even in the kitsch DIY scenes.
Collectionism is the newest route for art of all kinds. Image is no longer two dimensional, and extends the visual.
This expansion is the necessary way to express the complex ideas and questions of today’s society in a widely accessible fashio

$≠€

give the world authenticity thru something shitty,
a little bit of nothingness just to hide it


stories notes:
harder cut into interlude
slightly louder opera
slightly less warble fx on acoustic guitars
less overall fx on very last gtr chord
more background vox, still slightly increasing every verse
less stereo more mono drums ? maybe just a tad
cut out last handful (3?) drum hits (hard cut end on beat 4)


whats that word brandon always says, I always forget bc it isn’t in my daily vocabulary
some synonym for quasi/authentic, it becomes boring ?

earnest

    
this isn’t the time for sincerity or introspection
has my time passed? did I miss it?
How To Be Yourself in a Time Where No One Wants That So You Eventually Just Stop


CHAOS / CRISIS / CONTROL


this writer online said everything is a screen everything is a curtain
it’s everything hiding behind everything

psychonautica


ALLEVIATE SUFFERING -pain is inevitable, suffering is “optional”


holding hands with god -patti smith

you can’t crear inauthenticity the same way you can’t create authentication


intelligent brain rot
so much is just nothing
you’re just here for nothing
you’re not gonna get anything out of this


i’ve always been obsessed with overwhelming intense general emotion: bittersweet maximized
caused by, what it seems to be, to me, more nothingness. everything from nothing

morning doves in a song, morning doves on a wire, morning doves in a video


mmw notes:
vox DRY & processed
no repeat section on “decompose” line
-use for two lines elsewhere
-two lines before cold america
bass/low end organ
2:26  <3

I spent a lot of time thinking about losing my virginity and then I spent more time thinking about how I wish it happened different

this isn’t a confession but it could be the truth
many friends think i’m a liar
I don’t lie about serious things but sometimes it’s easy to get lost in the jokes only I know about
anyone can create a story
rewriting memories is easy, it’s a function of memory

why don’t you want me to be earnest with you anymore? you guys make it impossible for me to figure out how to share what’s on my mind without self consciousness and without fear
i’m good at being vulnerable until i’m done sharing


feed the dopamiiiiiiinne don’t let it stop


music becomes more than therapeutic. it’s allowed me to be obsessively controlling, mentally stable, story teller. I suppose I might have killed myyself without it. 
but the issue is I can’t figure out how to say everything I want.  still find myself stuck on writing of queerness and sex and politics and joy.
my obsession with bittersweet negativity will haunt me and limit me. I could allow this to become unhealthy very quickly. 


everything is a copy, regurgitation. anything original stems from something. how silly to think it could be yours alone without credit. copy copy copy

when I was younger I saw a letter from my uncle, he talked about seeing stars in the snow, and it worked my mom. most rings he’d ever done worried her
because he had schizophrenia, but i’m still convinced he saw the footprint of Vans tennis shoes. little stars of david freshly printed in snow. 
my memory of him is skewed and romanticized. I know he wrote letters to cousins but never to me. my parents were the ones to take classes to learn how to help someone with this illness.
I think he died when I was 15 but I hardly remember him at this point. odd memories that come from photos and stories.
mind man world actually just comes from something he included at the end of a letter, and then later he or someone in my family erased it.
